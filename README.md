# Project-Landing-Page-TheOdinProject

This project is a complete landing page built from a design provided in The Odin Project curriculum.

The page includes:
• A Hero section
• An Information section about the website
• A Testimonial section
• A Footer

This layout can serve as a template to kickstart future projects. It also demonstrates my ability to structure a page using modern layout techniques (like Flexbox) and apply clean, responsive styles.
